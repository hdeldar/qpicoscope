1. What files are included in this documentation?
	- INSTALL: explains how to install the driver on your Linux system.

	- 95-pico.rules: an example showing how to set access permission for 
           USB devices on Linux systems using udev.

	- usbtest: a script to help you check whether the current user of 
           the system has permission to access the USB devices.

	- PS2000con.c: an example program demonstrating the use of the
           PicoScope 2000 driver.

	- PS3000con.c: an example program demonstrating the use of the
           PicoScope 3000 driver.

	- PicoScope.conf: a system configuration file to load shared libraries 
	   to the system cache. Find more in INSTALL.

2. How do I install this driver?
	Please refer to the file INSTALL included in this documentation.

3. How do I use the example programs?
	- Firstly install the driver as described in INSTALL.
	- Then compile the example program, linking against the right
	  library:
	    For PS2000:  gcc -lps2000 PS2000con.c -oPS2000con
	    For PS3000:  gcc -lps3000 PS3000con.c -oPS3000con
	- Plug-in the unit.
	- Start the program:
	    ./PS2000con     or     ./PS3000con

4. What is usbtest for and how do I use it?
	If you are unable to access your PicoScope, a possible cause is that
	the relevant permissions are not set correctly on your Linux system.
	usbtest is a shell script which helps you diagnose such problems.

	- Type "./usbtest" in the shell to run it. 
        - Follow the on-screen instructions, including plugging in your 
	  PicoScope when requested.
	- The program will report whether the current user has permission 
	  to access usb devices. If they do not, some help has been included 
          in INSTALL. Alternatively, please consult your Linux documentation
	  or, if you do not administer the system yourself, please contact
	  your system administrator.
