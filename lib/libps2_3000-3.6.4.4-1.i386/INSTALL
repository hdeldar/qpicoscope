Installation instructions for the Pico Technology PicoScope 2000/3000 Linux Driver
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
1. You should be using Fedora Linux 8. The driver is supplied as an RPM package 
   built using Fedora 8, and has not been tested using any other Linux distribution.
   Pico cannot provide support on using this driver with any other setup.


2. Your system must be set up in such a way that all users who need to use
   the driver have write access to the USB device. The details of this may be 
   system-specific - some possible scenarios are covered below. If you are 
   using Fedora 8, please follow the first case:

	- On systems running udev (such as Fedora 8), you should create a 
	  custom rules file which sets the permissions on the relevant devices 
	  and copy it to /etc/udev/rules.d/ . There is an example rules file 
	  which includes detailed instructions on how to set this up in 
	  95-pico.rules.

	- Some other systems may be preconfigured with a group "usb" to which 
	  automatically-created USB device nodes belong. In this case, all 
	  you need do is add the relevant users to the "usb" group.

	- It may be possible to use the driver with non-udev based
	  systems (for example, older Linux systems) but we have not tested
	  this and cannot provide any support if you attempt to do so.


3. In order to use the example programs, your system will need to be set up to 
   allow you to build C programs. Specifically you will need relevant 
   toolchains and standard libraries. You will also need the tar and gzip programs 
   to extract the source code. All these programs form part of any Linux 
   distribution, but they may not always be installed by default. On Fedora, you 
   can install them using Package Manager under X Windows, or in a terminal 
   using package management tools such as yum and rpm. For details on how to use these
   tools, please refer to the official Fedora website.

   You can check whether these standard libraries have been installed using Package 
   Manager or rpm.


Installation:
1. Get the rpm package for the driver from the Pico Technology website:
	www.picotech.com


2. Go to the directory where you stored the package and install the software
   as root:
	rpm -U packagename
     If you need more information on how to install packages using rpm, please
     refer to this website:
	http://docs.fedoraproject.org/drafts/rpm-guide-en/


3. When the driver is installed for the first time, you will see the library and 
   header files are installed by default under /usr/local. You should ensure 
   that /usr/local/lib appears in /etc/ld.so.conf or copy 'PicoScope.conf' to 
   /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and then run:
        ldconfig
     to add the new library to the system cache.


4. You are now ready to start using the library in your programs (or why not
   start by taking a look at our example program?).
