Qpicoscope is a Linux Qt frontend for Picoscope 2000/3000 series from Pico Tech.

It is pretty useless now, or at least it can be used as a code example, since Picoscope released a beta version of their software available here:

This project is based on libraries provided by [Pico Tech](http://www.picotech.com) at this address: http://www.picotech.com/linux.html

It is written using Qt and Qwt.
